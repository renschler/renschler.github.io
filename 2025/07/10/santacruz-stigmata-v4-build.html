<h3 id="how-i-landed-on-the-santa-cruz-stigmata">How I landed on the Santa Cruz Stigmata</h3>

<p>My previous road bike was a 2017 Specialized Roubaix. I loved that bike — big fan of the FutureShock and the SWAT box storage. But it could only fit 32mm tires. I also own a 35 lb Trek hardtail with a coil fork and ~90mm travel, which is fun but outdated and heavy.</p>

<p>I wanted a single, multi-purpose bike: something that felt quick on the road but could be converted to trail mode with a suspension fork and bigger tires. That meant finding a frame that was <strong>suspension corrected</strong> — i.e. a frame where the rigid fork has a large axle-to-crown measurement similar to suspension forks, so that the bicycle geometry stays consistent when you switch between forks.</p>

<p>At the time of my purchase (winter 2024) there were a few bikes that I was choosing between:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Bike</th>
      <th>Pros</th>
      <th>Cons</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Stigmata v4</strong></td>
      <td>Downtube storage, 430mm a2c, racey look, 2x compatible, 2.1” rear / 2.2” front tire clearance</td>
      <td>No top tube mounts, $$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Lauf Seigla Rigid</strong></td>
      <td>2.25” tire clearance (front &amp; rear), top tube mounts, affordable, racey look</td>
      <td>419mm a2c, only 1x compatible, no downtube storage</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Salsa Cutthroat</strong></td>
      <td>483mm a2c (supports 100mm fork)</td>
      <td>Heavy, no downtube storage, not racey, boost spacing makes it harder to acquire road wheelset</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Propain Terrel</strong></td>
      <td>top tube mounts, downtube storage, 425mm a2c, affordable, 2x compatible, frame bag</td>
      <td>Availability, customer support concerns</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Originally I ordered the Propain Terrel in September when they ran a $1000 off sale. There was a 9 week delivery wait. When 9 weeks came around I reached out for an update and they told me I had to wait an extra 3 months. I decided to bail because I didn’t want to wait and I had read some bad customer support stories on reddit; plus I was frustrated that they hadn’t bothered to reach out as soon as they knew the build was delayed.</p>

<p>After canceling my Propain order, I demoed the Stigmata at the Santa Cruz factory store. The build I tried had the 40mm rock shox rudy fork. I’m glad I drove out there, I realized that (a) the stigmata is sweet (b) I definitely wanted suspension and (c) I wanted <em>more</em> than 40mm of travel.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CeSm-GBFwZk_Ac3Jo9YcQpzKAYqOqW3LTBGPm1SaY3I/edit?usp=sharing">google sheet</a> for playing with bike geos and suspension changes, and I realized that getting the 50mm fox tapercast fork or 60mm MRP fork wouldn’t change the stigmata’s geo much because of the larger 430mm a2c. The cuttthroat also boasts an impressive a2c but in the end it wasn’t racey enough for my taste so I pulled the trigger on the stigmata.</p>

<p>The market has continued to evolve since I made my purchase, there’s two more bikes I would consider today…</p>

      <td><strong>Cannondale Topstone</strong></td>
      <td>Downtube storage, 429mm a2c, 2x compatible, toptube mounts, 2.2” clearance front, kingpin rear compliance (might be esp nice if using dropper)</td>
      <td>$$, possibly limited rear clearance (~2”?), internal routing may complicate fork swaps</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Factor (TBD)</strong></td>
      <td>Downtube storage, suspension-corrected, top tube mounts, 2.2” front / 2.1” rear tire clearance (tbd)</td>

    </tr>

<h3 id="suspension">Suspension</h3>

<p>I ended up ordering the MRP Baxter 60mm fork when I saw it on sale. It turns out if you get the high-tire-clearance version, the real travel is closer to 70mm. It’s been excellent on trail rides.</p>

<p>I built the Stigmata using a Zeno hydraulic brake line coupler so I can quickly switch between rigid fork and suspension fork configurations. The swap process takes under 5 minutes and so far I haven’t had to bleed the brakes.</p>

<p>In the future, I might add a rear brake line coupler so I can do a full cockpit swap (flat bar and stem for MTB mode). For now, I just swap forks and wheels.</p>

<p>After my first few road rides I realized I was missing the comfort of the roubaix’s future shock. So I decided to pickup a 70mm Redshift ShockStop stem. This is actually why I ended up on a size small Stigmata. With the medium, I would’ve needed a shorter stem (55mm), and the ShockStop doesn’t perform as well at that length since the bars are closer to the pivot. <a href="https://www.pinkbike.com/buysell/4036771/">I have my medium build for sale on pink bike</a>.</p>

<p>I also have a dropper post remote cable installed. I haven’t used the dropper much locally, but in Tahoe it was 100% worth it — especially on mtn bike trails like Jelly Jack or Big Chief.</p>

<p>I’m curious to try the 50mm travel Fox Tapercast fork — it’s a half-pound lighter than the MRP Baxter and the shorter travel is probably fine on the tamer trails that we have on the peninsula.</p>

<h3 id="drivetrain">Drivetrain</h3>

<p>I’m running SRAM Transmission with a 10–52T cassette and 40T chainring. The <strong>range is fantastic</strong>, especially for hilly rides (we average ~100 ft vert/mi in our area). That said, I miss the tighter gear spacing of 2x. My cadence has to jump a lot to hold a constant output during shifts.</p>

<p>I might eventually switch to 2x or experiment with SRAM XPLR 13-speed if some third-party 13-speed cassettes come out (Garbaruk? e*thirteen?). It would be cool to use a 10-42t 13 speed cassette for road and then have a 10-48t or 10-50t 13 speed cassette on the gravel wheelset.</p>

<p>Also worth noting: <strong>Shimano’s mineral oil</strong> might be better than DOT fluid for the coupler setup. The Zeno couplers have minor leakage, and mineral oil is less corrosive — so might be a safer setup in the long term.</p>
